# Noval Corona Virus (COVID-19) Visualization and Prediction
<h2>What is COVID-19 ?</h2>
<h3>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.</h3><br>
<h2>Transmission Stages</h2>
<h3>

Stage 2: Local Transmission among family, friends, groups<br>
Stage 3: Significant Transmission where infected person becomes undetectable<br>
Stage 4: Transmission converts to endemic and uncontrollable<br></h3>
<h3>In Data visualization, we will be focusing on<br></h3>
<h4>1. Datewise Analysis 2. Countrywise Analysis <br></h4>
<h3>In Prediction, we will be using two Regression Models<br></h3>
<h4>1. Linear Regression 2. Polynomial Regression<br></h4>
